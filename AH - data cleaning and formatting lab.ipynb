Create a pandas DataFrame object that contains information about customers with a policy claim amount greater than the 75th percentile and a customer lifetime value in the bottom 25th percentile.\n","- Use DataFrame methods to calculate summary statistics about the high policy claim amount and low customer lifetime value data.
